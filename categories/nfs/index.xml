      <description>I like the flexibility of Proxmox, and this post covers spinning up my first LXC container, an NFS share.
Preliminary work Before spinning up the systems, there were a few things to do:
Load template I navigated to the storage (in this case my gluster volume), hit Templates button and added the latest centos-7-default container template. It was downloaded in a matter of seconds
Set DHCP and DNS Previously, I was generating MAC addressed based on the FQDN of the host, applying them to the VM, and entering them as static leases in my DHCP server.</description>

      <description>I have an NFS server on a KVM guest, and I want to integrate auth into my IdM server so I can have an automount readily accessible from any of the hosts.
Most of my hosts are CentOS 7, but my personal laptop is running Fedora 28.
What I&amp;rsquo;ve done already  The FreeIPA server is already installed (refer to the Red Hat 7 IdM Install Guide) Replica is already installed and providing failover CA and DNS services Hosts are registered with the FreeIPA server  Configure FreeIPA You need to add the service to both the client and server:</description>

      <description>In the process of setting up my NFS server, I ran into how best to attach a USB3 disk directly to the KVM guest for direct writethrough.
Pools vs. Raw My criteria for the solution were as follows:
 Portability. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be stuck with a disk I can&amp;rsquo;t read without KVM tools. Speed. I&amp;rsquo;m actually going to be using this disk. Low overhead. I don&amp;rsquo;t need KVM to worry about the disk.</description>

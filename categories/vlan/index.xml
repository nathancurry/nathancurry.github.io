      <description>Yesterday I configured the system network configuration on the OpenStack nodes, but I still have to configure VLAN access on the switch.
Overview Each system has two NICs, in large part to keep storage traffic on its own collision domain. The vlans are assigned thusly:
nic1: br-mgmt: purpose: &amp;#39;management traffic, admin&amp;#39; vlan: &amp;#39;native&amp;#39; network: &amp;#39;10.3.2.0/23&amp;#39; br-storage: purpose: &amp;#39;storage traffic&amp;#39; vlan: &amp;#39;5&amp;#39; network: &amp;#39;10.3.5.0/24&amp;#39; nic2: br-vlan: purpose: &amp;#39;non-tunneled virtual network&amp;#39; vlan: &amp;#39;native&amp;#39; network: &amp;#39;10.</description>

      <description>The OpenStack Ansible project includes examples for network configurations on Ubuntu, but not on CentOS. This is that journey.
Click here for this post&amp;rsquo;s git commit.
Preamble I took the &amp;ldquo;Test&amp;rdquo; configuration examples, which use 3 nodes, and decided to build around that.
My first failed attempt was to use the nmcli Ansible module. At the time of writing, I encountered a number of issues with this module on CentOS 7 with kernel-3.</description>

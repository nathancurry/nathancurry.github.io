      <description>My girlfriend is out of town, so now&amp;rsquo;s a great time to set up VLANs.
The Map I&amp;rsquo;m switching to 10.3.3.0/24, since that&amp;rsquo;s easier to type than 192.168.7.0/24, especially in the dark.
Private LAN  VLAN 1 10.3.3.0/25 Pool 80-126  Guest WiFi  VLAN 99 10.3.3.128&amp;sol;26 No routing to other subnets  IoT  VLAN 5 10.3.3.208&amp;sol;28 Restricted routes available to other VLANs  DMZ  VLAN 10 10.</description>

      <description>I just tentatively passed the ICND1 with a 925&amp;sol;1000, and I&amp;rsquo;m pleased with my performance. Obviously, I am honor-bound (and perhaps more importantly, legally bound) to not discuss the exam contents.
Preparation I began studying in late April. At the suggestion of a family friend and retired CCIE, I worked off the following materials:
 An all-in-one rack on eBay that had 3 1841 routers, 2 layer2 switches, and 1 layer3 switch for $300.</description>

      <description>This is a continuation of my previous notes on CCENT labs. These Ranet labs are significantly better-designed than the previous set of labs, though the evaluation at the end of the exam doesn&amp;rsquo;t always work.
These are my notes for all the labs that deal with ICND1 objectives, and I will save the ICND2 objectives for later when I review.
SPOILERS: DO NOT CONTINUE READING IF YOU PLAN ON DOING THE LABS</description>

      <description>This is a log of my work on last 6 of these PackTracer labs for the ICND1 exam.
SPOILER ALERT: Do your labs first, these are notes on how I resolved them.
Lab 7  PC0 cannot ping PC1, can you fix it?
 I verify that both PCs can ping as far as the outward-facing interface of R3. I furthermore verify that both R3 can ping R1, but not from its inside interface.</description>

      <description>This is a log of my work on the first 6 of these PackTracer labs for the ICND1 exam.
SPOILERS FOLLOW!!! This is not a guide on how to approach the problems, it&amp;rsquo;s a review of completed work. This perhaps has educational merit, but please continue only after having completed the labs yourself.
Lab 1  Switch0 is configured as DHCP server but not working. Can you fix it?</description>

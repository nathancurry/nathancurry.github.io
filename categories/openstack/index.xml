      <description>In parts 1 through 3, I&amp;rsquo;ve prepared my hosts and network environment for a smooth deployment. Please see those previous articles if you are using this as a reference.
Now comes the actual deployment.
Overview Since this is my first OpenStack deployment (other than an AiO RDO deploy in a VM), I used the openstack-ansible &amp;ldquo;test&amp;rdquo; configuration so I could have a fairly complete, functional setup.
To customize the install, you have to copy relevant files to /etc/openstack_deploy.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I configured the system network configuration on the OpenStack nodes, but I still have to configure VLAN access on the switch.
Overview Each system has two NICs, in large part to keep storage traffic on its own collision domain. The vlans are assigned thusly:
nic1: br-mgmt: purpose: &amp;#39;management traffic, admin&amp;#39; vlan: &amp;#39;native&amp;#39; network: &amp;#39;10.3.2.0/23&amp;#39; br-storage: purpose: &amp;#39;storage traffic&amp;#39; vlan: &amp;#39;5&amp;#39; network: &amp;#39;10.3.5.0/24&amp;#39; nic2: br-vlan: purpose: &amp;#39;non-tunneled virtual network&amp;#39; vlan: &amp;#39;native&amp;#39; network: &amp;#39;10.</description>

      <description>The OpenStack Ansible project includes examples for network configurations on Ubuntu, but not on CentOS. This is that journey.
Click here for this post&amp;rsquo;s git commit.
Preamble I took the &amp;ldquo;Test&amp;rdquo; configuration examples, which use 3 nodes, and decided to build around that.
My first failed attempt was to use the nmcli Ansible module. At the time of writing, I encountered a number of issues with this module on CentOS 7 with kernel-3.</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this other work, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about OpenStack and watching video presentations, and I deployed an AiO OpenStack VM with RDO. As things have progressed, I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered more and more ways in which Proxmox is deficient as a platform for automation.
I decided that if I&amp;rsquo;m going to suffer endlessly at getting something to work, it should be something worthwhile like OpenStack. So here we are.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m about to start working on installing FreeIPA servers, and I need to make a few small changes to variables as stored. The most efficient way was to use a few one-liners.
Rename inventory I want to rename all ansible hosts as their FQDN. I attack the ini-style inventory file like so:
nc@tiny: ~/0/homelab.ansible/ $ sed -i &amp;#34;s/[a-z1-9]$/&amp;amp;.lan.nathancurry.com/&amp;#34; inventory This simply matches each line that ends in either a letter or a number, and appends (the &amp;amp; operator) the rest of the FQDN.</description>

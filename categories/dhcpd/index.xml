      <title>Ansible Workflow 1: Spin Up DNS/DHCP Failover Pair</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on getting the individual pieces put together on this, and I finally have the entire thing working. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a playbook workflow that will deploy two containers, install BIND and ISC DHCPD, and start them.
What it will not do is update DNS automatically. I&amp;rsquo;m able to update the DNS manually with nsupdate, but it appears as though DHCPD isn&amp;rsquo;t even trying. For now, I&amp;rsquo;m moving on, and I will revisit with fresh eyes.</description>

      <title>Generating BIND Config From Ansible hostvars</title>

      <description>Since streamlining my container deployment, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on automating a BIND deployment. I found this excellent role over at MangoLassi.it, and I&amp;rsquo;m tailoring it to my needs.
Generating based on hostvars For now, I&amp;rsquo;m statically mapping IPs, MAC addresses, and a few other machine facts in host_vars, so that I have a defined infrastructure, even when the hosts don&amp;rsquo;t exist.
fqdn: &amp;#39;ns.lan.nathancurry.com&amp;#39; ip_address: &amp;#39;10.3.3.2&amp;#39; mac_address: &amp;#39;52:54:00:76:b4:78&amp;#39; services: [ &amp;#39;dns&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;dhcp&amp;#39; ] This allows me to keep key infrastructure facts in one place.</description>

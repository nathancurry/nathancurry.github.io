      <title>Ansible: Deploy DNS/DHCP Failover Pair</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on getting the individual pieces put together on this, and I finally have the entire thing working. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a playbook workflow that will deploy two containers, install BIND and ISC DHCPD, and start them.
What it will not do is update DNS automatically. I&amp;rsquo;m able to update the DNS manually with nsupdate, but it appears as though DHCPD isn&amp;rsquo;t even trying. For now, I&amp;rsquo;m moving on, and I will revisit with fresh eyes.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve broken down my HomeLab, and I&amp;rsquo;m rebuilding it in Ansible for deployment on a Proxmox cluster.
Configure Proxmox for ansible I&amp;rsquo;ve been working off morph027&amp;rsquo;s workflow for a first successful run. He uses the ansible plugin proxmox_kvm, and I&amp;rsquo;m using proxmox (for containers).
Infrastructure Short and sweet:
[proxmox] gold silver bronze Setup script To get my blood pumping, I wrote a playbook to configure the three nodes:

      <description>I freed up the system I was using to do data recovery is free, and so I&amp;rsquo;m finally adding my third node to my Proxmox+Gluster cluster.
Install Proxmox Same as before, allocated 8GB for swap, 10GB max for root, and 200GB for extra LVM partitions.
Create the gluster brick I ran into an issue that I had one fewer available physical extents on this disk due to it being a different model.</description>

      <description>I had initially planned on migrating from plain KVM to oVirt. My reasoning was thus:
 oVirt is the upstream of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, and I plan on pursuing higher Red Hat certifications It inegrates with OpenStack, another technology adopted by Red Hat It&amp;rsquo;s robust and flexible  However, upon installing * Documentation for RHEV is complete, but behind a version or two * Documentation for oVirt is poorly maintained, and some documents stop almost mid-sentence * Terraform plugins for oVirt are not ready for primetime * The network management is needlessly ornate</description>
